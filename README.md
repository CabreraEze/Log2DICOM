This script extracts relevant information from log files and uses that data to make appropriate modifications to DICOM files. Designed with precision and user-friendliness in mind, it streamlines the process of adjusting medical imaging data based on logged operations or events.

# Demo usage:
This stand-alone executable performs the core caracteristic of the main project, apply the recorded Logfile positions over the according control point instance in the original plan.

The usage is simple:
1. Import the DICOM RT plan.
2. Import either the corresponding Trajectorylog file/s, or only the A file/s for the Dynalogfile/s.
3. Export the modified plan to the selected folder. The `.dcm` file is named `{PATIENT ID}_mod.cdm`

The integration of this software could be done by a more complex GUI to make visual reconstructions, data analysis and more.
